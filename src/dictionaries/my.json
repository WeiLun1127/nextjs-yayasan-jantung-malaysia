Dengan pandemik COVID-19 yang berterusan, penyakit tidak berjangkit (NCD) seperti penyakit kardiovaskular dan hipertensi kurang mendapat perhatian. Walau bagaimanapun, COVID-19 boleh menyebabkan komplikasi serius kepada penghidap NCD, yang membawa kepada risiko penyakit teruk, kemasukan ke hospital dan kematian yang lebih tinggi. Ini membimbangkan kerana dianggarkan 3 dalam 10 rakyat Malaysia menghidap hipertensi dan 4 dalam 10 rakyat Malaysia mempunyai kolesterol darah tinggi."

    "subtitle": "Yayasan Jantung Malaysia (YJM)",
    "description": "The groundwork for today's solid base began in 1982. The Heart Foundation of Malaysia was established by a small group of dedicated and concerned lay people who were determined to make an impact on the control of heart and blood vessel disease.<br /><br />In the 1960's, deaths in Malaysia were due to communicable diseases such as tuberculosis, malaria, typhoid and cholera. Our health system was then developing and our health facilities were inadequate to meet the needs and demands of the population.<br /><br />With the improved standard of living and better understanding, now, there is a control of these diseases. However, more than 20 years later, heart disease death rates and stroke deaths have increased and has become the No. 1 killer. More people are being affected by heart and blood vessel diseases.<br /><br />We believe we can share in the effort to prevent and control the situation. Educating the public by bringing awareness has resulted in encouraging response from the society. Heart and blood vessel disease is our major killer, claiming almost twice as many lives as cancer and accounting for a high percentage of all certified deaths each year. In 1995, 28.2 % of all medically reported deaths in Malaysia were attributed to CVD (cardiovascular diseases). By international standards, this figure does cause a concern for Malaysia.<br /><br /><b>The Heart Foundation of Malaysia is a non-profit and non-governmental organisation</b> dedicated to the education of the public on heart and circulatory diseases. We are funded almost entirely by public support from our well-meaning society. In addition, we receive some limited government co-operation for specific projects. The Foundation's heart-health message is direct and effective - enjoy healthy eating, exercise, be smoke-free and check your blood pressure regularly."

For year 2000 we spent RM300,000.<br /><br />Since 1993 approximately RM99,000 has been awarded in project grants and fellowships to further research in studies related to the heart, and since then, the Foundation has been allocating RM 10,000 annually to fund research.<br /><br />The Foundation awards <b>The Fellowship Research Grant</b> annually and our Technical Committee is responsible for evaluating all applications for research funds and fellowships.<br /><br />Education is the key to healthier lifestyles and prevention. The Foundation offers a comprehensive series of publications for the interest of the public. We also provide resources to students, teachers, employers and community groups and the media.<br /><br />Many of the Foundations ongoing programmes are well known in the community, such as, the <b>Heart Week</b> which is held 4-6 times each year and at different locations in the country. We bring fun along with a fitness message, and through health screening and forums, we create interest and awareness about risk factors related to cardiovascular diseases, healthy living and heart to the community at large.<br /><br />The Foundation also works towards creating interest in <b>Basic Life Support</b>. We work with health professionals and conduct demonstrations in the life - saving technique of CPR (cardiopulmonary or heart lung resuscitation) to develop interest in the community.<br /><br /><b>Health promotion programmes</b> in schools and workplaces, to encourage provision of healthy food choices and exercise in a healthy smoke-free environment."

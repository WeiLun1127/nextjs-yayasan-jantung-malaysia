    "description": "The groundwork for today's solid base began in 1982. The Heart Foundation of Malaysia was established by a small group of dedicated and concerned lay people who were determined to make an impact on the control of heart and blood vessel disease.<br /><br />In the 1960's, deaths in Malaysia were due to communicable diseases such as tuberculosis, malaria, typhoid and cholera. Our health system was then developing and our health facilities were inadequate to meet the needs and demands of the population.<br /><br />With the improved standard of living and better understanding, now, there is a control of these diseases. However, more than 20 years later, heart disease death rates and stroke deaths have increased and has become the No. 1 killer. More people are being affected by heart and blood vessel diseases.<br /><br />We believe we can share in the effort to prevent and control the situation. Educating the public by bringing awareness has resulted in encouraging response from the society. Heart and blood vessel disease is our major killer, claiming almost twice as many lives as cancer and accounting for a high percentage of all certified deaths each year. In 1995, 28.2 % of all medically reported deaths in Malaysia were attributed to CVD (cardiovascular diseases). By international standards, this figure does cause a concern for Malaysia.<br /><br /><b>The Heart Foundation of Malaysia is a non-profit and non-governmental organisation</b> dedicated to the education of the public on heart and circulatory diseases. We are funded almost entirely by public support from our well-meaning society. In addition, we receive some limited government co-operation for specific projects. The Foundation's heart-health message is direct and effective - enjoy healthy eating, exercise, be smoke-free and check your blood pressure regularly."

It consists of 4 chambers - the right side of the heart separated from the left by a muscular wall - the septum, and the upper and lower chambers (atria and ventricles) are separated by valves. With each heart contraction, the blood is pumped out from the left ventricle to the whole body to supply oxygen and nutrients to all the tissues of the body.<br /><br />This 'used' or 'deoxygenated' blood then returns to the right side of the heart to the right Atrium and ventricle. From the right ventricle, the deoxygenated blood goes to the lungs where it receives fresh oxygen (re-oxygenated). This then returns to the left side of the heart and the circulation continues.<br /><br /><b>How Do Heart Valves Work?</b>",

A balanced eating plan can help control three modifiable risk factors for heart disease: blood cholesterol levels, obesity, and blood pressure.

Coronary heart disease (CHD), sometimes referred to as coronary artery disease (CAD), are general names for heart attack (and angina).<br /><br />A heart attack, or myocardial infarction, occurs when the blood supply to part of the heart muscle itself (the myocardium) is severely reduced or stopped. This occurs when one of the coronary arteries (the arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle) is blocked by an obstruction, such as a blood clot that has formed on plaque due to atherosclerosis. Such an event is sometimes called a coronary thrombosis or coronary occlusion.",

Angina is a symptom of a condition called myocardial schema, which occurs when the heart muscle (myocardium) doesn't get as much blood (hence as much oxygen) as it needs for a given level of work. Lack of blood supply is called ischemia.",

These people have silent ischemia. They may have a heart attack with no prior warning.",
    "what-is-heart-collateral-circulation": "What is heart's collateral circulation?",
    "what-is-heart-collateral-circulation-description": "Collateral circulation involves small arteries that connect two larger coronary arteries of different segments of the same artery. They provide an alternate route for blood flow to the heart muscle. Everyone has collateral vessels, at least in microscopic form. These vessels aren't open under normal conditions but grow and enlarge in some people with coronary heart disease. When a collateral vessel enlarges, it lets blood flow from an open artery to either adjacent artery or further downstream on the same artery. Myocardial ischemia stimulates the growth of collateral vessels, so they can form a kind of \"detour\" around a blockage and provide alternate routes of blood flow.<br /><br />Research has shown that while everyone has collateral vessels, they don't open and become available in all people. People who have open collateral vessels can benefit, because collateral vessels help protect heart muscle from tissue death if the normal blood supply is cut off.",

From there each impulse travels over the many specialized fibers of the His-Purkinje system, distributing the electrical \"ignition signal\" to the ventricular muscle cells.<br /><br />The transmission of impulses is delayed a fraction within the AV node. This allows time for the atrial contraction that helps fill the ventricles with blood.<br /><br />The term arrhythmias refers to any change from this normal sequence of beginning and conducting impulses. Some arrhythmias are so brief (for example, a temporary pause or premature beat) that the overall heart rate isn't greatly affected. However, if arrhythmias last for some time, they may cause the heart rate to be too slow or too fast.",
    "what-is-sudden-cardiac-death": "What is sudden cardiac death (SCD)?",
    "what-is-sudden-cardiac-death-description": "It's the sudden, abrupt loss of heart function (i.e., cardiac arrest) in a person who may or may not have diagnosed heart disease, but in whom the time and mode of death occur unexpectedly. The unexpected nature of the event is the key point in the definition.",
    "what-is-stroke": "What is a stroke?",
    "what-is-stroke-description": "Stroke is a form of cardiovascular disease that affects the arteries of the central nervous system. A stroke (or \"brain attack\") occurs when a blood vessel bringing oxygen and nutrients to the brain bursts or is clogged by a blood clot or some other particle. Because of this rupture or blockage, part of the brain doesn't get the flow of blood it needs. Deprived of oxygen, nerve cells in the affected area of the brain can't function and die within minutes. And when nerve cells can't function, the part of the body controlled by these cells can't function either. The devastating effects of stroke are often permanent because dead brain cells aren't replaced.",
    "what-is-rheumatic-heart-disease": "What is rheumatic heart disease?",
    "what-is-rheumatic-heart-disease-description": "Rheumatic heart disease is a condition in which the heart valves are damaged by a disease process that begins with a strep throat (streptococcal infection). If it's not treated, the streptoccocal infection can develop into acute rheumatic fever. Rheumatic fever is an inflammatory disease that can affect many connective tissues of the body, especially those of the heart, the joints, the brain or the skin. When rheumatic fever permanently damages the heart, the damage is called rheumatic heart disease.<br /><br />People of all ages can develop acute rheumatic fever, but it usually occurs in children 5 years to 15 years old. The resulting rheumatic heart disease can last for life.",
    "what-is-congestive-heart-failure": "What is congestive heart failure?",
    "what-is-congestive-heart-failure-description": "Congestive heart failure is a condition that occurs because the heart muscle is damaged or overworked. This damage can result from high blood pressure, a heart attack, atherosclerosis, a congenital heart defect, heart muscle disease (called cardiomyopathy), rheumatic fever or high blood pressure in the lungs resulting from lung disease. Because it's damaged, the heart lacks the strength to keep blood circulating normally throughout the body. The \"failing\" heart keeps working but doesn't work as efficiently as it should.",

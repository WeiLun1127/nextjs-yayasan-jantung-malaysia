With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as cardiovascular diseases and hypertension have received less attention. However, COVID-19 can cause serious complications to people with NCDs, leading to higher risks of severe illness, hospitalisation and death. This is worrying as an estimated 3 in 10 Malaysians have hypertension and 4 in 10 Malaysians have high blood cholesterol."

    "description": "The groundwork for today's solid base began in 1982. The Heart Foundation of Malaysia was established by a small group of dedicated and concerned lay people who were determined to make an impact on the control of heart and blood vessel disease.<br /><br />In the 1960's, deaths in Malaysia were due to communicable diseases such as tuberculosis, malaria, typhoid and cholera. Our health system was then developing and our health facilities were inadequate to meet the needs and demands of the population.<br /><br />With the improved standard of living and better understanding, now, there is a control of these diseases. However, more than 20 years later, heart disease death rates and stroke deaths have increased and has become the No. 1 killer. More people are being affected by heart and blood vessel diseases.<br /><br />We believe we can share in the effort to prevent and control the situation. Educating the public by bringing awareness has resulted in encouraging response from the society. Heart and blood vessel disease is our major killer, claiming almost twice as many lives as cancer and accounting for a high percentage of all certified deaths each year. In 1995, 28.2 % of all medically reported deaths in Malaysia were attributed to CVD (cardiovascular diseases). By international standards, this figure does cause a concern for Malaysia.<br /><br /><b>The Heart Foundation of Malaysia is a non-profit and non-governmental organisation</b> dedicated to the education of the public on heart and circulatory diseases. We are funded almost entirely by public support from our well-meaning society. In addition, we receive some limited government co-operation for specific projects. The Foundation's heart-health message is direct and effective - enjoy healthy eating, exercise, be smoke-free and check your blood pressure regularly."

However, public generosity in terms of donations in cash and kind enables the Foundation to participate in several services and campaigns to bring about an understanding in preventive education. We create an understanding of the extent of consequences that heart and circulatory diseases can have on our lives when unchecked.",

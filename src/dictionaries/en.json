    "Description": "YJM News (Newsletter of the Heart Foundation of Malaysia) Volume 55 Editorial Feature is entitled \"Keep NCD Prevention in Mind\". With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as cardiovascular diseases and hypertension have received less attention. However, COVID-19 can cause serious complications to people with NCDs, leading to higher risks of severe illness, hospitalisation and death. This is worrying as an estimated 3 in 10 Malaysians have hypertension and 4 in 10 Malaysians have high blood cholesterol."
